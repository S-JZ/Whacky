# Whacky
A basic Whack a Mole Game 
Made using Pygame module.
Tried and implemented concept of Threading for the hammer movements.

Pending Issues:
The game is glitchy. Need to look into a way to make the whole interface a bit smoother and the overall experience more interesting.
Need to work on the graphics.
The tapping of score needs to be re adjusted.
