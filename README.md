A basic Whack a Mole Game 
Made using Pygame module.
Tried and implemented concept of Threading for the hammer movements.



Setting up the game.
Download the code and make sure you have the latest version of Python3.
Install the PyGame Library onto your system.

The game is glitchy. Need to look into a way to make the whole interface a bit smoother and the overall experience more interesting.
Need to work on the graphics.
The tapping of score needs to be re-adjusted.
